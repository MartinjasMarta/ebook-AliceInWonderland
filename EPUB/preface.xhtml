            <p>All in the golden afternoon<br/>
                <span class = "indent">Full leisurely we glide;</span><br/>
                For both our oars, with little skill,<br/>
                <span class = "indent">By little arms are plied,</span><br/>
                While little hands make vain pretence<br/>
                <span class = "indent">Our wanderings to guide.</span><br/>
            </p>
            <p>
                Ah, cruel Three! In such an hour,<br/>
                <span class = "indent">Beneath such dreamy weather,</span><br/>
                To beg a tale of breath too weak<br/>
                <span class = "indent">To stir the tiniest feather!</span><br/>
                Yet what can one poor voice avail<br/>
                <span class = "indent">Against three tongues together?</span><br/>
            </p>
            <p>
                Imperious Prima flashes forth<br/>
                <span class = "indent">Her edict "to begin it"—</span><br/>
                In gentler tones Secunda hopes<br/>
                <span class = "indent">"There will be nonsense in it!"—</span><br/>
                While Tertia interrupts the tale<br/>
                <span class = "indent">Not more than once a minute.</span><br/>
            </p>
            <p>
                Anon, to sudden silence won,<br/>
                <span class = "indent">In fancy they pursue</span><br/>
                The dream-child moving through a land<br/>
                <span class = "indent">Of wonders wild and new,</span><br/>
                In friendly chat with bird or beast—<br/>
                <span class = "indent">And half believe it true.</span><br/>
            </p>
            <p>
                And ever, as the story drained<br/>
                <span class = "indent">The wells of fancy dry,</span><br/>
                And faintly strove that weary one<br/>
                <span class = "indent">To put the subject by,</span><br/>
                "The rest next time—" "It is next time!"<br/>
                <span class = "indent">The happy voices cry.</span><br/>

            </p>
            <p>
                Thus grew the tale of Wonderland:<br/>
                <span class = "indent">Thus slowly, one by one,</span><br/>
                Its quaint events were hammered out—<br/>
                <span class = "indent">And now the tale is done,</span><br/>
                And home we steer, a merry crew,<br/>
                <span class = "indent">Beneath the setting sun.</span><br/>
            </p>
            <p>
                Alice! A childish story take,<br/>
                <span class = "indent">And with a gentle hand,</span><br/>
                Lay it where Childhood's dreams are twined<br/>
                <span class = "indent">In Memory's mystic band,</span><br/>
                Like pilgrim's withered wreath of flowers<br/>
                <span class = "indent">Plucked in far-off land.</span><br/>
